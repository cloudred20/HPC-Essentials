**Introduction to HPC and the Command Line Interface**  
Brief introduction to using the command line for basic bioinformatics tasks, including logging in, navigating the file system, working with software modules, submitting jobs with Slurm, and fundamentals of the HPC.

1. Log in to HPC, request a compute node, and navigate file system
On Mac or Linux machines, open a terminal and enter the following:
```
ssh <username>@<hostname_or_ip_address>
```
* ssh: The command that starts the Secure Shell client.  
* <username>: Your unique identifier or Net ID on the remote system.  
* <hostname_or_ip_address>: The address of the remote machine you are trying to reach  
* Once you execute the SSH command, the system will prompt you to enter your password for the remote account.
